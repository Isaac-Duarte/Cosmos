# Cosmos
The [old repository](https://github.com/Isaac-Duarte/Cosmos-OLD) got moved and archived due to the SOAP Api being discontinued. 

This is a application that uses [GSXApi](https://github.com/Isaac-Duarte/GSXApi) library to automate tasks.

Right now all that is implemented is configuration and logging.
